# üöÄ Running
**I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot unless you want to contribute to the code.**

Use the official instance instead, which you can add to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=737236600878137363&permissions=18432&scope=bot%20applications.commands)!

Nevertheless, the installation steps are as follows:

1. Make sure `Docker` and `Docker Compose` are installed.

2. Clone the repository and change the working directory.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/IchBinLeoon/anisearch-discord-bot
    cd anisearch-discord-bot
    ```

3. Create a [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `BOT_TOKEN`.

5. Build the images and run the bot along with the database.
    ```
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
